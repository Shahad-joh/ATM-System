# ATM System

<dive>
ATM Systems is a project that aims to design and develop an automated teller machine system using java . The project consists of 4 main classes:

1. ATM class: This class is the main component in the project and executes the basic tasks of the ATM system. It includes algorithms for conducting financial transactions, managing bank accounts, issuing receipts, and executing basic commands for the ATM.

2. Admin class: This class is used to manage the ATM system and perform administrative tasks, such as adding new users, updating system settings, and monitoring system performance.

3. Transfer class: This class is used to transfer funds between bank accounts, either within the same bank or between different banks. It includes algorithms for verifying account information, calculating transaction fees, and ensuring the security of transactions.

4. User class: This class represents the users of the ATM system, who perform various financial transactions such as withdrawing cash, depositing funds, and checking account balances. It includes information about the userâ€™s account, PIN code, and transaction history.

Using these classes and their interactions, a secure and user-friendly ATM system can be designed to facilitate financial transactions for customers.
